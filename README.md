# AI-Automation-Concept-Styler
A Streamlit-powered application that uses Stable Diffusion to generate automotive design concepts based on text prompts. This repository provides a simple end-to-end prototype—including constraint handling, prompt-based generation, and a user-friendly interface for designers and enthusiasts.

Features
Generative AI with Stable Diffusion
Creates stylized vehicle images from text prompts (e.g., “A sleek sports car” or “A luxurious electric SUV”).
Basic Constraints Module
Automatically adds or modifies prompts to ensure minimal automotive features (e.g., “4 wheels”).
Streamlit Interface
Easy-to-use web UI with sliders for inference steps and guidance scale, plus a sidebar for device selection.
Modular Design
Clear separation of config, constraints, generation logic, and the front-end interface.
